I plan and orchestrate my modules with 10 weeks of content, weeks 2-11. I reserve week 1 for introductions and getting started. The syllabus includes the following main content in weeks 2-11. Physical Network design LAN Network design WAN Network design Zones and perimeters Case study I reserve week 12/13 for clean up at the end...or run over time if we need it. This is intended as a foundation module and has minimal prerequisites. It is assumed you already have an undergraduate degree in computing or a similar discipline. The material is thus pitched at people who can self-learn. I intend to provide the student with a solid grounding in network infrastructure requirements and practices both from a theoretical perspective and as an applied discipline. I began working with TCP/IP and Ethernet in the 1980s (!) and have been writing course and training material since the late 1990s. This module was written in 2015 and is updated annually, the most recent syllabus update in 2022. If you are doing this module remotely, you need a good modern computer, review my \"Getting Started notes now to understand what you need. In these documents, there are key terms. These will be italicized . You may need to look up these terms to get a full understanding of them. Commands are generally shown in bold . Reference Material If you are new to networking, I recommend Computer Networks, 6th edition, Published by Pearson (July 14, 2021) although earlier versions of the book are cheaper and almost perfect for understanding the underlying principles.

I have tried to acknowledge and cite sources, if you think I have missed crediting someone else's work, please contact me by university e-mail and I will remedy. If you find errors in my notes or something has been superseded without me noticing, please let me know. The pace of technological development assures that my notes have a very short shelf life. They are intended to be a starting point for your studies, not the end point.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Networking (L9) Welcome to this module, intended to cover Networking at L9, 10 credit equivalent.

Changing platforms has been the bane of my life. Moving my documents to an open format and to a technology that I can sync and save seems to be a good idea. And using a static site generator leaves me independent of any changes that come along to services in the future. After two years of experimentation, this is a new dedicated teaching account as of mid-2025. Retirement is hopefully not too far away! I want the notes to be available to my students after I retire, this is one way to do so.
