# Introduction

!!! abstract "Networking (L9)"

Welcome to this module, intended to cover Networking at L9, 10 credit equivalent. I plan and orchestrate my modules with 10 weeks of content, weeks 2-11.

I reserve week 1 for introductions and getting started.

The syllabus includes the following main content in weeks 2-11.

- Physical Network design
- LAN Network design
- WAN Network design
- Zones and perimeters
- Case study

I reserve week 12/13 for clean up at the end...or run over time if we need it.

This is intended as a foundation module and has minimal prerequisites. It is assumed you already have an undergraduate degree in computing or a similar discipline. The material is thus pitched at people who can self-learn. I intend to provide the student with a solid grounding in network infrastructure requirements and practices both from a theoretical perspective and as an applied discipline. I began working with TCP/IP and Ethernet in the 1980s (!) and have been writing course and training material since the late 1990s. This module was written in 2015 and is updated annually, the most recent syllabus update in 2022.

If you are doing this module remotely, you need a good modern computer, review my "Getting Started notes now to understand what you need.

In these documents, there are key terms. These will be _italicized_. You may need to look up these terms to get a full understanding of them.

Commands are generally shown in __bold__.

## Reference Material

If you are new to networking, I recommend 

_Computer Networks, 6th edition, Published by Pearson (July 14, 2021)_

although earlier versions of the book are cheaper and almost perfect for understanding the underlying principles.
