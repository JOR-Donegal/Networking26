# Week 1
I have covered [Getting Started](https://jor-donegal.github.io/GettingStarted26) in another module. 

So for this week, just some (light!) reading.

1. You need to read some theory to get started, specifically [Physical Network Theory (PNT)](https://jor-donegal.github.io/pnt26/). 

2. Understanding the generic concept of Layered Models.

3. Read a little about [Legacy Technology](https://jor-donegal.github.io/LegacyCommunications/), we need to know the terminology.

If you are new to networking, I recommend 

_Computer Networks, 6th edition, Published by Pearson (July 14, 2021)_

although earlier versions of the book are cheaper and almost perfect for understanding the underlying principles.
