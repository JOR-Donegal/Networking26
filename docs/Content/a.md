# Week 1
I have covered [Getting Started](https://jor-donegal.github.io/GettingStarted26) in another module. Make sure you have read this and are fully familiar with the content.

So for this week, just some (light!) reading.

## Actions

1. You need to read some theory to get started, specifically [Physical Network Theory](https://jor-donegal.github.io/pnt26/). 

2. You must understand the generic concept of [Layered Models](https://jor-donegal.github.io/LayeredModels26/).

3. Read a little about [Legacy Technology](https://jor-donegal.github.io/LegacyCommunications/), we need to know the terminology.
