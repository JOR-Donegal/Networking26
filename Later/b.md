# Week 2
Before you begin this week, make sure you have already completed my exercises in [VMWare Workstation](https://jor-donegal.github.io/VMWareWorkstation26), which I cover in a different module. 
- If you are working on a laptop, you should have already installed this. 
- If you are working in University laboratories, this is already installed.

You need a way to carry out network exercises with the operating systems of real appliances as we would use in production. This week, try to get GNS3 working. Keep detailed notes of what you do, such that you or any other student in the group could recreate the work. 

We need to become familiar with working at the command line interface of Cisco devices. Work through all these exercises and ensure you understand them. Keep detailed notes of what you do, you will need them later. 

You now know how to do initial setup on a switch when you take it out of the box. If you keep the scripts from this or take listings from the switch, you have a record of your work which you can use to recreate it.
